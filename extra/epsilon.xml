<!-- Put this file in your working directory, and the renderer parameters
     (which the interface asks you to enter) will be automatically filled
     in, if they are in this configuration file. This is just a template.

     For instance if you are testing something, you can preset everything
     except the number of passes to reasonable values, such that you only
     need to enter the number of passes, every time you render something. -->
