Some notes to myself.

- need a better system to load geometry - XML just isn't going to cut it in the
  long run once bigger scenes are available. Thinking about a system where each
  model is stored in a single .obj file, and the geometry.xml file simply lists
  those .obj files.

- materials are hardcoded, need an extra indirection layer to decouple geometry
  from materials. Or one could load materials and geometry together.. not good.

Todo:

X fix the interface scrolling through platforms/devices, which *still* doesn't
  work for some reason.

- PDCurses seems to have issues with getstr(), and tends to overwrite borders.
  Fix this by redrawing the border after each field input under Windows.

- Damn macros under Windows/MinGW, need to fix that.
