Some notes to myself.

- need a better system to load geometry - XML just isn't going to cut it in the
  long run once bigger scenes are available. Thinking about a system where each
  model is stored in a single .obj file, and the geometry.xml file simply lists
  those .obj files.

- materials are hardcoded, need an extra indirection layer to decouple geometry
  from materials. Or one could load materials and geometry together.. not good.
