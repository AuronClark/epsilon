Some notes to myself.

- Doxygen seems to want to merge the OpenCL structs with the C++ classes of the
  same name. I guess this is fitting somehow, so I'll consider it a feature and
  not a bug. Until a future revision breaks it, anyway.

X need a better system to load geometry - XML just isn't going to cut it in the
  long run once bigger scenes are available. Thinking about a system where each
  model is stored in a single .obj file, and the geometry.xml file simply lists
  those .obj files.

X materials are hardcoded, need an extra indirection layer to decouple geometry
  from materials. Or one could load materials and geometry together.. not good.

Todo:

X fix the interface scrolling through platforms/devices, which *still* doesn't
  work for some reason.

X PDCurses seems to have issues with getstr(), and tends to overwrite borders.
  Fix this by redrawing the border after each field input under Windows.

X Damn macros under Windows/MinGW, need to fix that.

- Make sure the infinite loop in the kernel actually terminates in reasonable
  time (not just theoretically). Perhaps modify russian roulette to enforce
  a sensible minimum probability of failure, but this could cause issues for
  scenes with very deep ray paths (subsurface scattering, notably).
