</p>
This was the first scene with more than a dozen triangles rendered when the BVH
was ported to the OpenCL kernel. Here mostly for historical reasons.

<img src="https://github.com/TomCrypto/epsilon/blob/master/render/dragon.png?raw=true" alt="Diffuse Dragon/Lucy"/>
</p>
Diffuse dragon + Lucy scene, with 625k triangles. This was to test the BVH, and
was a (relative) success. The colors were scaled back a bit for aesthetics.

<img src="https://github.com/TomCrypto/epsilon/blob/master/render/depth_of_field.png?raw=true" alt="Depth-of-Field"/>
</p>
This is a render showing the depth-of-field effect, with the staircase's cross-
section in focus. The effect was exaggerated (by purpose or by accident... your
choice!)

<img src="https://github.com/TomCrypto/epsilon/blob/master/render/depth_of_field_open.png?raw=true" alt="Outdoor Depth-of-Field"/>
</p>
This is an outdoor scene showing the depth-of-field effect even more clearly...
Sorry for abusing the staircase model, but it is a rather good test scene.
